The Fish Passage Extension for ArcGIS 10.0

--> Description <--

This project is an Add-In (formerly an Extension) for ArcGIS Desktop.  
** It is currently only compatible with ArcMap 10.0 **

The toolset enables analysis of river systems to assess connectivity.  
It leverages and extends upon the existing features and tools provided
for network analysis in ArcGIS, using the "geometric network" model.  

--> Timeline of Development <--

 * The toolset was created and developed by Fisheries & Oceans Canada, 
Maritimes Region, Habitat Management & Sustainable Development Division
(2006 - 2010). 

* In 2011, the toolset was released to the public under a Canadian 
Creative Commons Attribution Sharealike License v2.5.

* In 2010 - 2012, the toolset was further developed by Parks Canada
with additional functionality for assessing the Dendritic Connectivity
Index (DCI) for river systems. Parks Canada also upgraded compatibility 
of FIPEX from ArcGIS 9.x to 10.0.

* Concurrently, in 2009 - 2013, the lead developer branched development
to add additional functionality for FIPEX to work with the GLPK and Gurobi
optimisation software.
